# Learn F# Through Mathematical Programming

A collection of programming exercises and examples from mathematical textbooks, implemented in F# and Python.

## 📚 Source Materials

- **[HR]** *The Haskell Road to Logic, Math and Programming* - Doets & van Eijck  
- **[CTFP]** *Category Theory for Programmers* - Milewski
- **[GA]** *Contemporary Abstract Algebra* - Gallian

## 🎯 Approach

- **Haskell → F#**: All Haskell code examples and exercises converted to F#
- **C++ → Python**: Computational exercises originally in C++ implemented in Python
- **Focus**: Practical programming exercises and implementations, not theory notes

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Install F# development environment
2. Install Python 3.x
3. Navigate to specific exercise directories
4. Follow README instructions in each chapter

## � Usage

Each exercise directory contains:
- Source code files with implementations
- Comments referencing original textbook sections
- Simple test cases or examples
- Minimal explanation of key concepts (when needed for context)

This is a practical companion to the textbooks, not a replacement for reading them.
